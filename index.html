<h1>Bob Krueger</h1>

<p> I started my math PhD at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in Fall 2019. Before that, I attended at Miami University, where I majored in math and physics and minored in statistics and computer science. You can contact me at my illinois.edu email rak5. </p>

<p> This purpose of this website is to hold links to things I have created or am interested in. </p>

<h2>Games</h2>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://garretrc.github.io/splode/">Nodesplosion</a>: a competitve chip-firing game. Looking for worthy adversaries. </li>
  <li> <a href="Minesweeper.html">Minesweeper <i>sans Boring</i></a>: the easy parts are automated. Board sizing is weird because that part of javascript isn't fun. </li>
  <li> Twist-Tac-Toe: you can twist a subboard instead of placing a token. Still need to port this from java to javascript. </li>
  <li> <a href="linecovering.html">Covering Chessboard with Lines</a>: an intriguing geometric problem. The obvious extremal problem seems particularly hard! </li>
</ul>
